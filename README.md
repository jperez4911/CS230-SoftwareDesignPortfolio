## Reflection

### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements
The Gaming Room is an organization that focuses on online multiplayer games. Their goal for this project was to broaden the reach of their well-known game, Draw It or Lose It, by developing a cross-platform version compatible with web, mobile, and desktop platforms. The client required a game system design that was both scalable and secure, enabling numerous teams and players to engage within various instances of the game.

### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe that I did particularly well in effectively presenting the architectural design and implementing software design patterns, including the Singleton and Iterator patterns, to illustrate how the system could uphold consistent game states and manage multiple players and teams efficiently. The document was structured in a manner that facilitated comprehension for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document acted as a blueprint that minimized uncertainty throughout the developement phase. It clarified system responsibilities, data flow, and object interactions at an early state, facilitating a smoother transition to writing functional Java code that aligns with client requirements.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If given the opportunity to revise a specific section, I would provide a more comprehensive discussion on error-handling and edge-case scenarios within the system architecture segment. Although the document briefly addressed anticipated user behaviors, it could be enhanced by detailing how the system ought to react to invalid inputs, lost network connections, or unauthorized access.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs through a thorough examination of the project specifications, user narratives, and anticipated system functionalities. Features like user role management, secure gaming sessions, and multi-team support were incorporated into the design. Taking the user's needs into account guarantees that the software is user-friendly, effective, and aligns with client expectations, which has a direct impact on adoption and satisfaction.

### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My approach included breaking down the project into distinct modules, pinpointing essential classes and their relationships, and utilizing UML diagrams to illustrate system interactions. Additionally, I used design patterns to improve reusability and scalability. Looking ahead, I would incorporate more peer feedback and conduct early usability testing scenarios to confirm that the design meets actual user expectations prior to the commencement of coding.
